Waiting on 'virtualizing' the ctx GT/axis classes

In the future, an implementation reference of the broker that gets passed to
the factory should be able to be a proxy to contact an offsite broker etc.,
since it should be a fully decoupled service (remote client can and will also
be able to orchestrate with broker).

====

One issue with the context broker in general is that the bootstrap
information contains IP addresses.  This allows the VM to easily
figure out its own multi-NIC situation, to map the NICs it sees to the
NICs the context broker is describing to it.

Until a good solution for that is found (there are pitfalls), we have the
concept of a bootstrap text format that the workspace service implementation
needs to fill in at the last minute with the IPs and nic names. So the syntax is
not encapsulated by the context broker (in the next iteration it needs to be).
