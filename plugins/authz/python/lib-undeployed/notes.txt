These jars are so that we do not need to deploy the VOMS and GridShib
plugins just to build and deploy the Python authorization callout.

If the classloader can not find the appropriate classes (i.e., if
those plugins are not deployed to the container), it just does not
support sending VOMS or SAML attributes to the Python script but
does not consider this an error.

The GridShib project also releases software under an Apache v2 license.
