# One way to do to launch the context agent at boot is to put this in
# the "rc.local" file or equivalent.  Another way is to make an init
# script, but one nice property of the "rc.local" style method is that
# those are almost always rigged to run last which is usually what you'd
# like to do.  With an init script, you'd need to fuss with ordering.

# Note that you can start the context agent without fear of system alteration
# if the bootstrap file is missing.  If you did not boot the VM with 
# contextualization, the "/var/workspace-contextualization-bootstrap" file
# won't be there and the agent will just exit.  This allows you to leave the
# rc.local entry while you boot into "maintenance" mode to adjust something
# then save back to repository.
