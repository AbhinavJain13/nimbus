# A sample network pool 'public'

# The first non-blank, non-comment line must be the DNS server you would
# like to tell the VMs receiving addresses from this network pool to use.

# DNS server IP address (or 'none')
192.168.0.1

# The rest of the file's non-blank, non-comment lines are the addresses
# that will be leased out to VMs requesting this network.

# Currently there are no syntax shortcuts, each field must have an entry
# or the keyword 'none'.

# The IP address and hostname fields may not be 'none'.
# If the gateway is 'none', no gateway is assigned.
# If broadcast or subnetmask are 'none' they are derived from the IP
#   - based on the normal subnet and broadcast for the IP class (A,B,C)


# hostname ipaddress gateway broadcast subnetmask
