Only used after "--ctx-create-injectable", not after "--ctx-create" 

Signal that no more injections will be made to the context.  This allows the
context broker to proceed, otherwise it cannot determine whether the information
it delivers to the VMs is a complete/correct response or not.  Once the response
is complete, the workspaces can stop querying for context information and
proceed with running.


Required:
========

--eprFile (-e) <file>   EPR file of the particular context to signal with
                        noMoreInjections.

Also see "--help" and "--extrahelp"
