Miscellaneous:

--eprFile (-e) <file>             During a "--deploy", you can use this in lieu
                                  of the "--service" parameter, to load the
                                  factory EPR from a file.  This is usually
                                  unecessary and not recommended.

--displayname <name>              Nickname for local printing.

--override-listener-address <ip/host>[:port]

                                  If subscribing using notifications (not poll)
                                  you can use this to override the address that
                                  is sent to the service.  Notifications will
                                  be sent to this address, not the default.
                                  If no port is given, it will use the port
                                  that the listener bound to -- this is the
                                  recommended use (don't supply a port unless
                                  you know what you are up to).

Grid security settings (these are usually unecessary):

--anonymous (-a)                  Use anonymous authentication (requires either
                                  -m 'conv' or transport (https) security).
--serverCertificate (-c) <file>   A file with server's certificate used for
                                  encryption. Used in the case of GSI Secure
                                  Message encryption.
--descriptor (-f) <file>          Sets client security descriptor. Overrides
                                  all other security settings.
--delegation (-g) <mode>          Performs delegation. Can be 'limited' or
                                  'full'. (requires -m 'conv')
--contextLifetime (-l) <value>    Lifetime of context created for GSI Secure
                                  Conversation (requires -m 'conv')
--securityMech (-m) <type>        Sets authentication mechanism:
                                  'msg' (for GSI Secure Message),
                                  or 'conv' (for GSI Secure Conversation).
--protection (-p) <type>          Sets protection level: 'sig' (for signature),
                                  or 'enc' (for encryption).
--authorization (-z) <type>       Sets client authorization of server:
                                  'self', 'host', 'none' or a string specifying
                                  the expected identity of the remote party
                                  (Default 'host')
