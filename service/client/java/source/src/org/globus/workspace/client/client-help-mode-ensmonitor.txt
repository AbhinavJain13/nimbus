Client will query about the enemble and exit successfully if all ensemble
members are 'Running'.  Client will exit with error if one or more ensemble
members moved to Corrupted/Cancelled.  Can write reports about what
happened (see optional args).


Required:
========

--eprFile (-e) <file>  EPR of the ensemble workspace resource to monitor.

--poll-delay <ms>      Poll frequency.


Optional:
========

--exit-state <state>   Use this to explicitly set the successful state (default
                       is 'Running').  Choose from: Unstaged, Unpropagated,
                       Propagated, Runnning, Paused, TransportReady, StagedOut.
                       Note that "all <state>" only pertains to the status at
                       one point in time.

--reportdir <path>     Path to directory for report files.  In either exit case
                       (success or error-present), if this argument is supplied,
                       a text file report for each workspace will be written to
                       this directory.
