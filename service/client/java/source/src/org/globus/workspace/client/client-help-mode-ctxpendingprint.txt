==========

Print IP addresses of cluster nodes that were launched but have not registered with the broker
as OK or ERR.

Unadvertised option, only really works with Nimbus clusters launched with the cloud-client.
And it is usually only invoked programatically via the cloud-client's --print-pending option. 

This will only exit successfully if all context members have moved to 'OK'.  Otherwise, it
will exit with an error code 6 after printing all of the IP addresses, one per line, of nodes
in the cluster launch that don't have an OK report in the context yet.

NOTE: If there is another problem (for example, an ERROR was reported by a node to the context
or there is a given parameter issue), the client will exit with an error code besides 0 or 6. 


Required:
========

--eprFile (-e) <file>    EPR of the context to query.

--epr-ip-dir <dir>       The directory to the ip/id recordings directory.
