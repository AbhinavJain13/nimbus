Triggers unpropagation (workspace image file moved back to repository).


Required for shutdown-save:
==========================

--eprFile (-e) <file>  EPR of the single or group workspace resource to
                       shutdown-save (trigger unpropagation).

                       If a group EPR is given, the service will perform
                       shutdown-save on each workspace in the group that has
                       not been destroyed already.

Optional for shutdown-save:
==========================

--save-target <url>    Override the unpropagation target set at creation time.
                       This was either supplied or was set to the default, which
                       is to replace the source file.

                       If a group EPR is given, the service will unpropagate
                       all remaining members of the group, using this argument
                       as a base name.

--nosubscriptions      Triggers client to NOT subscribe for workspace changes
                       after creation.  Any subscription related argument will
                       be ignored.

--no-auto-destroy      Triggers client to NOT terminate the workspace resource
                       after success or problem.

                       NOTE:

                       The default behavior for shutdown-save is to DESTROY the
                       workspace when the *TransportReady* state is reached or
                       if the workspace becomes Cancelled or Corrupted.

Also see the subscribe action section for other optional parameters (you can
use polling mode, etc.).
