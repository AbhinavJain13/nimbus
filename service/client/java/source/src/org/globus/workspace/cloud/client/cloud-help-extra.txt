Workspace Cloud Client.  See README.txt for examples and overview.

These flags are usually intended to be supplied behind the scenes or in less
common situations.

Some default option values are contained in the configuration file(s).

    Option precedence:
         1. command-line arguments
         2. user supplied properties file
         3. embedded default properties file in the cloud client jar

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Every action may have:

    --debug (-d)             Enables debug mode.

    --conf <path>            Path to user supplied configuration file. Normally
                             this will be "conf/cloud.properties" found by
                             cloud-client.sh but you can override this. 

    --append-cadir <path>    Add this directory to the list of trusted CA dirs.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Miscellaneous actions:

    --print-file-URL         Print out the target transfer URL (for example,
                             in order to make a transfer via another means).

    --print-service-URL      Print out the target factory service URL (for
                             example, in order to directly use a workspace
                             client).

    --networks               Print the available networks (see contextualization
                             guide and the sample cluster definitions).

    --print-ctx-status       Print IP addresses and contextualization status of
                             cluster nodes that were launched.  The output is
                             somewhat self explanatory, the full explanation of
                             output and return codes can be obtained by running
                             this command (the flag is indeed different):

                             $ sh ./lib/workspace.sh --help --ctx-print-status

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Required "--print-file-URL" options:

    Use --name OR --sourcefile

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Required "--print-ctx-status" options:

    Use --handle <cluster-name>

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Required "--print-service-URL" options:

    None.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Other "--run" options:

    --ec2script <path>       Used with "--cluster" only, to aid with contextual-
                             ization on EC2.  This will create a context at the
                             context broker, print EC2 commands to use
                             elsewhere, and go into context monitoring mode.
                             The <path> is where a shell script will be written
                             with the EC2 commands to use.  It may need to be
                             altered in order to get the exact behavior you
                             want, see "ec2-run-instances -h".  For contextuali-
                             zation to work, the user-data arguments in the
                             sample commands must remain the same.

    --factory <host:port>    Factory service ip/host and port.  URL will be
                             constructed from it.

    --factory-id <DN>        Instead of using host based authorization, use
                             this DN to authorize the remote server (the client
                             authorizes it is talking to bona fide server).

    --ssh-pubkey <path>      SSH pubkey to send, if any.  File contents will be
                             placed in "/root/.ssh/authorized_keys" and so this
                             could be a list of keys. 

    --history-dir <path>     Directory to write EPR files, logs, and other
                             artifacts (program will create a new, unique
                             directory under this given directory).

    --poll-interval <ms>     How many milliseconds to wait between state polls.

    --notifications          Use asynchronous notifications for state reports
                             rather than polling the workspace service (polling
                             is the default).  Requires that your computer is
                             not behind a restrictive firewall or NAT (although
                             there are a couple of tactics in those cases).

    --newname <name>         This changes the default shutdown behavior from
                             "destroy" to "save to a new target file", given
                             <name> is the target file.  Before running time
                             expires you can override this choice by using the
                             "--save" action with a new name (or of course by
                             using the "--terminate" option which will cause
                             nothing to be saved).

    --kernel <name>          If you have coordinated with the administrator to
                             use an alternate kernel, add this option with the
                             appropriate kernel name to use with the launch.

    --broker-url <URL>       If the context broker is not colocated with the
                             Nimbus factory service that a cluster launch will
                             go through, use this URL instead.

    --broker-id <DN>         If the context broker is not colocated with the
                             Nimbus factory service that a cluster launch will
                             go through, use this DN instead of using host based
                             authorization.

    --no-ctx-lock            Use when you don't want a cluster to proceed with
                             contextualization just yet.  The cloud client will
                             still wait for context updates.  But meanwhile in
                             another terminal, you can use the workspace client
                             to inject data into the context and then manually
                             cause contextualization to proceed.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Other "--transfer", "--download", and "--delete" options:

    --gridftp <host:port>    Image host's ip/host and port.  URL will be
                             constructed from it.

    --gridftp-id <DN>        Instead of using host based authorization, use
                             this DN to authorize the remote server (the client
                             authorizes it is talking to bona fide server).

    --targetdir <path>       Image host's base directory (above your personal
                             directory).  URL will be constructed from it.

    --timeout <hours>        Number of hours before timing out.  Can be partial
                             hours, for example "0.2" value is 12 minutes.
                             Value of zero (or lower) means no timeout.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Other "--security" options:

    --cahash <hash>          Hash of the target cloud, for diagnostics only.


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Other "--status" options:

    --epr-file <path>        Instead of supplying a handle (which is used to
                             determine where the EPR file is) you can specify
                             an EPR path directly.

    --factory <host:port>    Factory service ip/host and port.  URL will be
                             constructed from it.

    --factory-id <DN>        Instead of using host based authorization, use
                             this DN to authorize the remote server (the client
                             authorizes it is talking to bona fide server).

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Other "--terminate" options:

    Same as "--status".
