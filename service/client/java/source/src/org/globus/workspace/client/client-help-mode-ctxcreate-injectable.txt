Just like --ctx-create, but the context broker will wait for data injections
from a client before proceeding.  This allows you to send data into the context
that might be dependent on just in time configuration data (perhaps based on
the hostnames that were assigned, etc.).

Same arguments as --ctx-create, see "-h --ctx-create"

Also see "--help" and "--extrahelp"
