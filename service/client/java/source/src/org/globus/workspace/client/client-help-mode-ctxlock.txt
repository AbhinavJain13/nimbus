==========

Lock a context.  This allows the context broker to proceed, otherwise it cannot
determine whether the information it delivers is a complete/correct response
or not.  Once the response is complete, the workspaces can stop querying for
context information and proceed with running.

You can achieve the same effect by sending "--last-in-ctx" with the deploy
action, but you may not want to in certain situations (see "-h --ctx-data").


Required:
========

--eprFile (-e) <file>   EPR file of the context to lock.

Also see "--help" and "--extrahelp"
