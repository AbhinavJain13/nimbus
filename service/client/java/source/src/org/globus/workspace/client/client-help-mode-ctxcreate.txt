==========

Create a new context with a context broker.


Required:
========

--service (-s) <url>       Context Broker URL


Optional (but probably desired):
================================

--file <path>              File where the handle (EPR) of the created context
                           will be written. Later operations on the context can
                           take this path as an argument (usually as the "-e"
                           option).

--ctx-contact-xml <path>   File where the broker contact XML snippet will be
                           written.  Note this contains the secret that agents
                           on VMs will use to contact the broker.
