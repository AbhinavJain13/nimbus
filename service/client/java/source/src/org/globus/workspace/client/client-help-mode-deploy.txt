Launches individual workspaces or groups of workspaces.  Options available
for handling ensembles (coscheduling) and contextualization.


Required for deploy:
===================

Factory Service:

    --service (-s) <url>    Service URL

Metadata:

    --metadata (-w) <path>  Path to metadata file for the workspace to
                            create.

                            See the GLOBUS_LOCATION/share/workspace_client
                            directory for samples of each.

Deployment description (resource request):

  From a file:

    --request (-r) <requestPath>    Path to deployment request file, see
                                    GLOBUS_LOCATION/share/workspace_client
                                    for samples.

                                    If --numnodes, --trash-at-shutdown,
                                    --deploy-duration, --deploy-mem, or
                                    --deploy-state are also given, those
                                    given argument(s) will OVERRIDE what
                                    is in this file.

  From the commandline:

    These can be used alone or override parts/all of a given file.

    --deploy-duration <duration>    Minimum running duration (in minutes).
    --deploy-mem <mb>               Memory allocation (megabytes).
    --deploy-state <state>          Initial state of deployment.  See end
                                    of help text for valid state values.

    See --numnodes.  If not given and using only --deploy-* arguments, the
    number of nodes is assumed to be one.

    See --trash-at-shutdown.  If not given and using only --deploy-* arguments,
    the requested shutdown mechanism will be 'Normal'.

    See --save-target.  If not given and using only --deploy-* arguments,
    the unpropagation target (if any) will be the same as source.

Optional for deploy:
===================

  --optional (-o) <path>   Path to file with optional parameters for the
                           creation request (such as staging).
                           See $GLOBUS_LOCATION/share/workspace_client for
                           samples.

  --file <path>            File where the handle (EPR) of the created
                           workspace will be written. Later operations on
                           the workspace can take this as an argument (see
                           "-e" options).

                           If starting a group of workspaces, this is used
                           as the base file name for multiple workspace
                           instance EPR files.

  --groupfile <path>       File to write Group EPR of create workspace
                           group to.  Operations that act on an entire
                           group need this file to be specified (see "-e"
                           options).

  --numnodes (-n) <num>    If given, causes a deployment to be a group
                           request of <num> nodes.  This can also be
                           specified in deployment request file.

  --trash-at-shutdown      If given, causes workspace service to destroy
                           the workspace(s) when running time has been
                           exceeded.  This is a common mode of operation
                           with compute node VMs, for example.  This can
                           also be specified in deployment request file.

  --save-target <url>      Override the unpropagation target. If a group EPR is
                           given, the service will use this as a base name.

  --nosubscriptions        Triggers client to NOT subscribe for workspace
                           changes after creation.  Any subscription related
                           argument will be ignored.

  --exit-state <state>     Client will exit once the given state has been
                           reached.  If this is a group deployment, it will
                           only exit once every member of the group has
                           reached this state (once per group member, no
                           matter what happens to each after reaching it).

                           See end of help text for valid state values.

  --groupprint             Causes single workspace print output to resemble
                           group behavior.

  --new-ensemble <path>    Requests new ensemble to be created with the
                           deployment and writes the EPR to <path>.  Will
                           not overwrite existing file at <path>.

  --join-ensemble <path>   Requests deployment be joined with ensemble
                           resource specified by EPR <path>.

  --last-in-ensemble       Triggers the service to call 'done' on the
                           ensemble after the deployment.  This alleviates
                           the need for another client invocation.  This
                           may only be used with the "--join-ensemble"
                           argument.

  --sshfile <path>         Requests customization task of replacing root
                           authorized_keys file.  If tasks are defined in
                           an optional parameters file being used (XML),
                           they will all be overwritten by this one task.

  --mdUserdata <path>      Requests that contents of the specified path be
                           placed in the Nimbus Metadata Server's user data
                           field for this launch.  Each group of VMs gets
                           unique userdata (i.e. you can have different userdata
                           for different groups in an ensemble).

  --delegate (-u) <delegationServiceURL>

                           Create a delegated credential resource for use
                           in optional parameters as staging credential if
                           it does not exist in the optional parameters
                           document explicitly.

  --delegatetime (-q) <delegLifetime>

                           Lifetime of the delegated credential when using
                           the --delegate option.

  --delegateXf (-t)        Used with --delegate to force using delegated
                           credential as the transfer credential as well.

  Also see the subscribe action section for other optional parameters.
