==========

Print IP addresses and contextualization status of cluster nodes that
were launched.

Unadvertised option for the "workspace.sh" program, it works best with
Nimbus clusters launched with the cloud-client and it is usually only
invoked programatically via the cloud-client's --print-ctx-status option.

Sample output (fields can be split by awk):

118.135.125.1     [CTX_CHECKED_IN_PENDING]
118.135.125.17    [CTX_CHECKED_IN_PENDING]
118.135.125.28    [CTX_NOT_CHECKED_IN]

This will only exit successfully if all context members have moved to
'OK'.  Otherwise, it will exit with an error code 6 after printing all
of the IP addresses, one per line, of VMs in the cluster launch and
their contextualization status.

NOTE: If there is another problem (for example, there is an issue with
a given parameter issue), the client will exit with an error code
different than 0 or 6.


[CTX_SUCCESS]
=============

This means that the node with that IP address has reported "OK" to the
context broker, it has gotten all of the information necessary and has
run the on-VM contextualization scripts to set everything up and become
"operational."


[CTX_ERROR]
===========

The VM has successfully established communications with the context
broker but there was an issue during contextualization so it reported
an error to the context broker.  If you launched with the cloud-client,
there will normally be a "reports" directory in the history directory
with the error messages written out to files.


[CTX_CHECKED_IN_PENDING]
========================

The VM has successfully established communications with the context
broker but it is still waiting for a "complete" response with all
of the information it needs from other VMs.  It is normally the
case that this state will happen while VMs are booting up, some
have not even initially contacted the broker yet.


[CTX_NOT_CHECKED_IN]
====================

This VM has not established any communication channel with the
context broker.  It could have never launched, be booting up, or
have failed to communicate with the broker at all due to a network
or configuration issue.


If using directly via lib/workspace.sh (which would be odd):
===========================================================

--eprFile (-e) <file>    EPR of the context to query.

--epr-ip-dir <dir>       The directory to the ip/id recordings
                         directory that were written at launch
                         time.
