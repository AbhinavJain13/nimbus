==========

Inject data into a context.  This allows you to send data into the context
without needing to include it in the contextualization requirements definition.
One often useful reason to do this is if the data is not available before
launch.  The context may not be locked already, so you can not use this if
you launched with the "--last-in-ctx" flag (which locks the context).  After
you're done injecting, you must call "--ctx-lock" action manually.


Required:
========

--eprFile (-e) <file>   EPR file of the context to inject data to.

--file <file>           File with the data.  Currently needs to be a text file.

--dataname <name>       Name of the data, a context member will receive the
                        data if its contextualization document lists this data
                        name as required.
