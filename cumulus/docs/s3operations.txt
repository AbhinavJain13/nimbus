GET Service
============
Description

This implementation of the GET operation returns a list of all buckets owned by the authenticated sender of the request.

To authenticate a request, you must use a valid AWS Access Key ID that is registered with Amazon S3. Anonymous requests cannot list buckets, and you cannot list buckets that you did not create.
