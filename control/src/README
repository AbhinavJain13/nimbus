Developer notes
===============

This document will be expanded in the future.


Testing/development
===================

Sample:

$ nosetests --nologcapture -x -v -w src/python/workspacecontrol/main

During (test driven) development this can be conveniently combined with:

$ ./sbin/cat-latest-logfile.sh

... in order to view the log output from the last-run test.
