[libvirt]

# What hypervisor is libvirt talking to?
# Valid choices:
#   "xen3" - http://libvirt.org/drvxen.html
#   "kvm0" - http://libvirt.org/drvqemu.html
#   "mock" - http://libvirt.org/drvtest.html (this does nothing)

vmm: xen3


[libvirt_connections]

# You should be able to connect using the "virsh" tool with these strings.
# For example, if you are using 'xen3' and the value here is "xen:///" you
# should test a command like "virsh -c xen:///"
#
# See the libvirt documentation and adjust this connection string for your
# particular situation.  You cannot use workspace-control if that command
# does not work from the *nonroot* account that workspace-control runs as.

xen3: xen:///
kvm0: qemu:///system
