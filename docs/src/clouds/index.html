<h2>Science Clouds</h2>

<p>
Science Clouds provide compute cycles in the cloud for
scientific communities using <a href="http://workspace.globus.org">Nimbus</a>.
</p>
<p>
The Nimbus cloud client allows you to provision
customized compute nodes (that we call "workspaces") that you have
full control over using a leasing model based on the Amazon's EC2
service.

</p>
<p>
    The Science Clouds have two objectives: (1) to make it easy for
scientific and educational projects to experiment with cloud computing
and (2) to enable us to learn how to make cloud computing a useful
tool for the scientific community.

</p>
<p>
    If you use any of these clouds, and have
requests, comments, or suggestions please send them to us at <a
href="mailto:workspace-user@globus.org">workspace-user@globus.org</a>
    (<a href="/contact.html">subscribe</a>). We
will very much appreciate your feedback.

the clouds below. </b>Read cloud configuration notes carefully to ensure
that you end up with the right software and configuration.

<p>
<b> Use the science clouds as a client: </b> In a typical session you will make a request to
deploy a workspace based on a specified VM image. You can either use
one of the VM images already available on a cloud (the workspace cloud
client provides a command that allows you to see what's already there)
or upload your own VM image. On deployment, the image will be
configured with an ssh public key you provide -- in this way once the
workspace is deployed, you will be able to ssh into it and configure
it further, upload data, or run your applications.  Follow the
<a href="cloudquickstart.html">quickstart</a> for specific instructions.

<p>
  <b>Launch one-click, auto-configuring clusters:</b> Once you have gotten 
  a feel for things with one VM, head over to the 
  <a href="clusters.html">clusters page</a>.  Launch virtual clusters with one
  command!  And no need to go configure anything:  cluster configurations are
  automated with the workspace context broker.  Each VM launches a very
  lightweight agent that greatly simplifies dealing with changing cluster
  topologies, identities, and credentials (no secrets need to reside on the
  image before booting).  Useful sample clusters await you.

<b> Build your own EC2-like cloud using the workspace service: </b>
<a href="../downloads/index.html">Download the workspace service</a> to configure your own resources into a cloud.  It accomodates a wide range of pre-existing cluster and network setups.  See the current version's
<a href="/vm/_WORKSP_CURRENT_VM_VERSION/doc/cloud.html">Cloud Guide</a>.

<p>
    Be aware: Science clouds are a beta project deployed on a modest allocation
    of resources. Over the next few months we will be evolving the software
    in response to your requests and comments.
</p>
<p>
    Therefore, be aware that
    the client code may change frequently as new features, services and
    clouds become available.
</p>
<p>
    Each change will be announced on
    workspace-user@globus.org (<a href="/contact.html">subscribe</a>) and via
    <a href="/rss.xml">RSS</a>: keep an eye on those announcements to
    ensure that your client is up-to-date.
