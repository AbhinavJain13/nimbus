<h2>Introduction to Nimbus @ UC</h2>

<p>

The University of Chicago Science Cloud, codenamed "Nimbus", provides
compute capability in the form of <a href="http://xen.org/">Xen</a>
virtual machines (VMs) that are deployed on physical nodes of the
University of Chicago <a href="http://teraport.uchicago.edu/">TeraPort
cluster</a> (currently 16 nodes) using the <a
href="http://workspace.globus.org">Nimbus</a> software. 

<p>

The Nimbus cloud is available to all members of the scientific community wanting to
run in the cloud. To obtain access you will need to provide a
justification (a few sentences explaining your science project) and a
valid grid credential (If you don't have a credential, email us. We
can help). Based on the project, you will be given an allocation on
the cloud. Send your requests to Nimbus administrators at <a
href="mailto:nimbus@mcs.anl.gov">nimbus@mcs.anl.gov</a>.

<p>

In a typical session you will make a request to deploy a workspace
based on a specified VM image. You can either use one of the VM images
already available on a cloud or upload your own VM image. On
deployment, the image will be configured with an ssh public key you
provide so that you can log into your VM once it is deployed. <b>Instructions on how to use the cloud are available 
<a href="cloudquickstart.html">here</a></b>. Have
fun!

<p>

<h3> Important Configuration notes: </h3>

<ul>
<li>Nimbus provides public IP addresses for user's VMs. Thus, you will not need
private network software to work with Nimbus.</li>
<li>Nimbus works with version 10 or later of the workspace cloud client
    (see <a href="cloudquickstart.html#download">instructions</a> for download).</li>
</ul>

<p> 
    To start using Nimbus download the workspace cloud client and follow
    the setup instructions. You will need the following:
</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="cloud.properties">Nimbus configuration file</a></li>
<li>A valid PKI X509 certificate</li>
</ul>

<h3> EC2 clients: </h3>

<p>
  To try the EC2 clients, download this
    <a href="http://s3.amazonaws.com/ec2-downloads/ec2-api-tools-1.3-24159.zip">EC2
    client</a> from Amazon.
</p>

<p>The specific URL to use:</p>

_EXAMPLE_GENERICCMD_BEGIN
export EC2_URL=https://tp-vm1.ci.uchicago.edu:8445/wsrf/services/ElasticNimbusService
_EXAMPLE_CMD_END

<p>
</p>

<p>
  See the <a href="../vm/_WORKSP_CURRENT_VM_VERSION/elclients.html">EC2 client notes</a> for more
  information.  You will likely run into some of the EC2 client problems listed
  in the
  <a href="../vm/_WORKSP_CURRENT_VM_VERSION/admin/troubleshooting.html">troubleshooting</a> guide.
</p>

<p>
  These requests are not perpetual like on Amazon.  The current running time
  requested from the backend scheduler and authorization system is
  three hours.  You will not be "charged" for the whole amount if you use
  "terminate-instances" to destroy the VMs earlier than this.
