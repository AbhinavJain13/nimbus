<h2>Upgrading from Nimbus TP2.1 to TP2.2</h2>

<p>
    <i>Only the accounting records database can be preserved</i> (copy the
    entire "var/nimbus/WorkspaceAccountingDB/" directory into a new install).
    The service database must be deleted and re-installed.  You need to make
    sure no VMs are currently running in order to do the upgrade.
</p>
<p>
    You should make a fresh install of everything and work the "etc" directory
    changes in using 'diff -r'.
</p>
<p>
    <b>Don't worry</b>, it's not bad.  It's likely you did not even make any
    changes to the affected configuration files (see the list below).  For all
    the other ones you can copy in your old files.
</p>
