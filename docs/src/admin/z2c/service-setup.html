<h2>Service Installation</h2>

<p>
    On this page, you will install the Nimbus central services and
    image repository (<i>Cumulus</i>), and use a cloud
    client to access your cloud as a remote client.
</p>
<p>
    This will however only work in "fake mode" which means that the
    service is only pretending to start VMs.  In later steps you will
    enable VMMs, connect them with the central service, and have a
    working cloud setup.
</p>
