User Create Scenarios:

        - details: Upload them, extract DN for cert, do nimbus rest call to create user.

    2. "Provide User's DN"
        - details: "The User has a trusted certificate, I have the User's DN"

    3. "Auto-create a new certificate"
        - details: "The embedded CA will be used to create a new certificate"



Success of any of the 3 steps should end in a unique url,
