----------------- Nimbus autocommon ------------------
http://github.com/nimbusproject/nimbus/tree/master/autocommon/
Built from same branch in git as the webapp release.
Apache2 licensed.
Exact source used is included in tarball.

To build (and replace the tarball in this directory), run the following
special, toplevel Nimbus dist command:

    ant -f scripts/lib/gt4.0/dist/build.xml web-autocommon

That commands needs the "bin" "autocommon" and "web" directories to coexist
in the same  top level directory (like they do in git).

Common development command from inside web/ directory if you are working on
a change in autocommon:

    ant -f ../scripts/lib/gt4.0/dist/build.xml web-autocommon && 
    ./sbin/clean-slate.sh && 
    ./bin/run-standalone-ssl.sh
