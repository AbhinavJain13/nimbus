<p>Bridge between messaging layers and service/RM implementations</p>

<p>
    General dcumentation about the whole API will go here in the future.  It
    is good to see a diagram of the API's intent as well as current examples
    before delving into the actual API documentation.  A good introduction can
    be included on this page.

<p>
    For now, see the {@link org.nimbustools.api.brain.BreathOfLife}
    documentation.
